% Common packages to import

% ### MATH PACKAGE
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
% Popular packages from the American Mathematical Society that provide
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% If bold math operators are desired, the bm package is suggested
\usepackage{bm}
% its documentation can be found at http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm



% ### GRAPHICS PACKAGE
%\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% to ensure centered multiline captions, the centering package should
% be called as well.
%\usepackage[justification=centering]{caption}
% To use the subfigures command, the subcaption package should be
% called as well.
%\usepackage{subcaption}
% To declare the path(s) where your graphic files are use
% \graphicspath{{figures/}}
% To declare their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics:
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% A good introduction to inserting figures in a document can be found
% at:
% https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_Write_a_Thesis_in_
% 	LaTeX_(Part_3):_Figures,_Subfigures_and_Tables
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png).



% ### ALGORITHM PACKAGE
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% This package provides an algorithmic environment to describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm.



% ### TABLE AND ALIGNMENT PACKAGE
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls.



% ### URL PACKAGE
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% ### BIBL:ATEX PACKAGE
% \usepackage[%
% backend=biber,
% natbib=true,
% style=apa,
% ]{biblatex}

% \addbibresource{bib_example.bib}

%APA7
%For the time being biblatex-apa is the only implementation of 7th-ed. APA citation and bibliography style. Note that you need at least version 9.0 (released 2019-11-23) of biblatex-apa (https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-apa).
%
%In particular a document using biblatex-apa must be compiled with Biber instead of BibTeX (some background is at bibtex vs. biber  - https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib), so you may have to reconfigure your editor:
%Biblatex with Biber: Configuring my editor to avoid undefined citations
%https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations.


% ### HYPERLINKS PACKAGE
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
% This package is used to emend cross-referencing commands in LaTeX to
% produce some sort of \special commands; there are backends for the
% special set defined for HyperTeX dvi processors, for embedded pdfmark
% commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and dvipsone), for
% dviwindo, for pdfTeX, for dvipdfm, for TeX4ht, and for VTEX's pdf and
% HTML backends.
% Needs to be loaded AFTER other packages as it overwrites many standard
% commands.
% See: https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref?lang=en
