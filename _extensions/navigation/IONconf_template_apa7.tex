% Common packages to import

% ### MATH PACKAGE
%\usepackage{amsmath}
%\usepackage{amssymb}
% Popular packages from the American Mathematical Society that provide
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% If bold math operators are desired, the bm package is suggested
%\usepackage{bm}
% its documentation can be found at http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm



% ### GRAPHICS PACKAGE
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% to ensure centered multiline captions, the centering package should
% be called as well.
% \usepackage[justification=centering]{caption}
% To use the subfigures command, the subcaption package should be
% called as well.
% \usepackage{subcaption}
% To declare the path(s) where your graphic files are use
% \graphicspath{{figures/}}
% To declare their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics:
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% A good introduction to inserting figures in a document can be found
% at:
% https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_Write_a_Thesis_in_
% 	LaTeX_(Part_3):_Figures,_Subfigures_and_Tables
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png).



% ### ALGORITHM PACKAGE
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% This package provides an algorithmic environment to describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm.



% ### TABLE AND ALIGNMENT PACKAGE
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls.



% ### URL PACKAGE
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% ### BIBL:ATEX PACKAGE
\usepackage[%
backend=biber,
natbib=true,
style=apa,
]{biblatex}

\addbibresource{bib_example.bib}

%APA7
%For the time being biblatex-apa is the only implementation of 7th-ed. APA citation and bibliography style. Note that you need at least version 9.0 (released 2019-11-23) of biblatex-apa (https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-apa).
%
%In particular a document using biblatex-apa must be compiled with Biber instead of BibTeX (some background is at bibtex vs. biber  - https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib), so you may have to reconfigure your editor:
%Biblatex with Biber: Configuring my editor to avoid undefined citations
%https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations.


% ### HYPERLINKS PACKAGE
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
% This package is used to emend cross-referencing commands in LaTeX to
% produce some sort of \special commands; there are backends for the
% special set defined for HyperTeX dvi processors, for embedded pdfmark
% commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and dvipsone), for
% dviwindo, for pdfTeX, for dvipdfm, for TeX4ht, and for VTEX's pdf and
% HTML backends.
% Needs to be loaded AFTER other packages as it overwrites many standard
% commands.
% See: https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref?lang=en

\section{INTRODUCTION}

This document serves as a \LaTeX  draft for paper submissions to conferences of the Institute of Navigation (ION). It is intended to support and facilitate manuscript preparation for authors.


\section{Paper organization}

Paper may be broken into sub-sections as desired. Sub-section titles should be writting in title case. First-level headings should be numbered, flush left, bold, and written in title case; text begings on a new line (indent first line). Second-level headings should be numbered, flush left, bold italic, and written in title case; text begins on a new line (indent first line). Thried-level headings should be unnumbered, indented, bold, title case, and ending with a period; text shoudl begin on the same line. Fourth-level headings should be unnumbered, indented, bold, italic, title case, and ending with a period; text should begin on the same line.

Papers submitted for peer review should not exceed the Maximum of 15 Pages. There is no page limit for papers not undergoing the peer review process.\\
Full justify your text. Use automatic hyphenation and check spelling. Digitize or paste down figures.\\
Disclaimers or notes should be placed at the end of the article just prior to references.

\subsection{Use of Figures}

Incorporate graphics in the body of the text, centered within the text. Figure numbers should appear at the bottom of the figure in bold font followed by the figure title/caption. Give each figure a brief but descriptive title, and capitalize the figure title in italic title case.

% % Graphics are placed like in the following example (where the width should be adjusted depending on the image).
% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{IONlogo}
% % where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% % and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% % via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions. Other suffixes like .png are added manually.
% \caption{The ION turns 75 in 2020.}
% \label{fig:ION}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Use of Tables}

Tables should be centered within the text. The table number should appear above the table title and body in bold font. Number the tables in the order in which they are mentioned in your paper. The title of the table should appear one double-spaced line below the table number.


% % A table adhering to these guidelines is created in this example.
% \begin{table}[h]
% % increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
% \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% % if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% % \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
% \caption{An Example of a Table}
% \label{tab:example}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
% \hline
% One & Two\\
% \hline
% Three & Four\\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

\subsection{REFERENCES}

For the time being biblatex-apa is the only implementation of 7th-ed. APA citation and bibliography style. Note that you need at least version 9.0 (released 2019-11-23) of biblatex-apa (\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-apa}).

In particular a document using biblatex-apa must be compiled with Biber instead of BibTeX (some background is at bibtex vs. biber  -- \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib}), so you may have to reconfigure your editor:
Biblatex with Biber: Configuring my editor to avoid undefined citations
\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations}.


In 2023, the ION switched to the APA7 style reference formatting. References should be listed in alphabetical order in the text, and should appear at the end of the paper. Follow the APA style according to the 7th Edition Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association.
In this template, the \textit{biblatex} package is used. This matches the ION formatting guidelines very well while using BibTex.
Use \verb|\citep{}| or \verb|\autocite| and \verb|\citet{}| or \verb|\textcitet| as desired.

\section{language}

Your paper must be in English.

\section{additional instructions for electronic paper preparation for publication}

Electronic files (PDF File) should be uploaded the ION’s Abstract Management Portal at \url{www.ion.org/abstracts}. If your paper was created in \LaTeX, convert to PDF file before submitting.


\section{acceptable software}

Adope Acrobat PDF files.

ION cannot accept \LaTeX files, all \LaTeX documents must be converted to PDF file prior to submission. Make sure the file is formatted properly before uploading to the AMP.  Documents converted from the \LaTeX or TeX typesetting language into the Adobe’s Postscript of PDF files usually contain fixed-resolution bitmap fonts that do not print or display well on a variety of printer and computer screens.

Secure files can cause problems with: opening the document; printing the document; indexing for searchability on the CD-ROM. \textbf{\large{Please do not secure your files.}}
